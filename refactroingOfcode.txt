-->About Us
✔1. In the website, can we have the general visuals and the silver editorial font smaller, which makes it look neater(example - figma) - currently it looks very scattered, need to make it more concise in visuals.
✔2.The main text written - "Fair question, Here's our answer....." - increase font size, but not have it spread across the width of the website. The attention to remain concise, mainly in the centre of the screen for our customers/viewers.
(image needed from client)3.Check on the final quality of the images used in this slide, the image seems to be pretty pixelated.
✔4.Same as for the written text before, have it concise at the centre, increase font size, and convert to bold font, (as in figma ref.)


(I dont see this issue.)1.Shop Collection Creative - font and design change
✔2.Colour of the Prices showed and the top headers ( home, tops, shirts, etc) - will be Ivory Fern - #DFE8C3
